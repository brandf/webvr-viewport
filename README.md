# webvr-viewport
A viewport controller for hosting WebVR content on desktop, mobile, and VR browsers.

WebVRViewport handles viewport size changes, device orientation changes, and the transition into WebVR and back while maintaining a proper aspect ratio and field of view for your scene.

It is not tied to a specific rendering engine, however WebVRViewportEffect has been included in webvr-viewport-three to support Three.js rendering.
